# The Distinction Constraint

## Overview: Constraints, Not Proposals

The Distinction Constraint does not posit a primitive or advance an ontology. It makes explicit a condition already operative wherever anything is taken to be *something* at all. Any attempt to articulate, encounter, or model anything as determinate presupposes a distinction sufficient to prevent total collapse.

Any proposed primitive—substance, process, relation, experience, information, law, or being itself—must be specified as *something rather than something else*. That specification already involves distinction. This is not because distinction is simpler, more elegant, or metaphysically fundamental, but because it is the only candidate that does not require itself to be distinguished from something else in order to function. Attempts to go “beneath,” “behind,” or “prior to” distinction collapse into indeterminacy, since such locutions already presuppose contrast.

This is not a limitation of language or representation. The issue is not that alternatives cannot be named, but that they cannot be made determinate—counted as anything at all—without some form of non-collapse being in play. Where nothing is distinguished from anything else, nothing is thereby specified; where nothing is specified, nothing counts as anything.

Claim-making in the relevant sense is not merely linguistic. To observe something as being the case, to experience something as thus rather than otherwise, to model the world, or to treat something as structured rather than undifferentiated already presupposes determinacy. Language is one expression of this activity, not its source.

Distinction is understood here in a purely structural sense. No commitment is made to binary opposition, negation, identity conditions, conceptual articulation, logical form, or phenomenological salience. “Distinction,” “difference,” and “contrast” function as interchangeable labels for the minimal requirement that something count as *this rather than not-this*, in whatever way suffices to prevent total collapse.

The framework therefore does not propose a metaphysical thesis or compete with accounts of what exists. It fixes constraints on admissibility: conditions that must already be in force for anything to count as determinate at all. These constraints are constitutive rather than assertoric. They do not describe reality independently of engagement with it; they diagnose the conditions under which anything can be encountered, taken, or treated as being the case.

For this reason, rejection is not the appropriate model. One does not meaningfully reject these constraints while continuing to observe, experience, or model anything as determinate. One can only abandon them by abandoning determinacy altogether. Such a stance does not constitute a competing position, but a withdrawal from the activity of claim-making. That withdrawal forecloses the possibility of articulating a contrary position, rendering the Distinction Constraint transcendental in form.

## The Foundational Constraints (FC1–FC5)

### FC1 — Determinacy Requires Distinction

**Statement**
For anything to count as determinate at all—whether as a claim, an observation, an experience, or a presentation—it must be distinguishable as *this* rather than *not-this*.

**Constraint Type**
Constraint on determinacy.

**Role**
This constraint fixes the minimal condition under which anything can count as something. A purported item that excludes no alternatives does not determine content and therefore does not count as anything determinate. This does not deny phenomenality or immediacy; it fixes only the conditions under which something counts as determinate rather than indeterminate.

**What It Constrains**

* Treating undifferentiated givenness as sufficient for determinacy
* Treating sheer presence or occurrence as contentful without contrast
* Treating the mere introduction of a label as sufficient to determine something

---

### FC2 — Meaningful Predication Requires Conditions of Application

**Statement**
Any meaningful use of predicative vocabulary—such as “is,” “exists,” “is fundamental,” or “is possible”—presupposes conditions under which it would apply rather than fail to apply.

**Constraint Type**
Constraint on predication.

**Role**
Predication is inherently contrastive: to apply a predicate is to distinguish its applicability from its non-applicability. A predicate lacking conditions of application does not express an ineffable truth; it fails to function as a predicate at all.

**What It Constrains**

* Bare existential claims without criteria
* Ontological vocabulary insulated from contrast
* Appeals to being that cannot be specified as applying or failing to apply

---

### FC3 — Nothing Prior to All Distinction Is Admissibly Positable

**Statement**
Any posit described as prior to, outside of, or more fundamental than all distinction lacks conditions of application; accordingly, no predicate can meaningfully apply to it.

**Constraint Type**
Constraint on ontological positability.

**Role**
This is the primary eliminative hinge of the framework. It blocks the introduction of substrates, grounds, or “being itself” described as standing outside the space of distinction while still being treated as something. The issue is not ineffability or epistemic limitation, but functional indeterminacy: without application conditions, nothing counts as being the case rather than not.

**What It Constrains**

* Fundamental ontology posited as prior to intelligibility
* Ineffable-but-real substrates
* Reality described as outside all distinction while remaining something

---

### FC4 — No Privileged Meta-Level

**Statement**
The admissibility constraints apply without exception, including to claims about the constraints themselves.

**Constraint Type**
Constraint on scope and reflexive stability.

**Role**
This constraint prevents the reintroduction of illegitimate positability via a privileged standpoint. There is no level at which one can step outside the conditions of determinacy while still making determinate claims about them. The framework does not justify these constraints; it shows that any attempt at justification already presupposes them.

**What It Constrains**

* Meta-ontological escape hatches
* Appeals to perspectives “outside” all distinction
* Frameworks that exempt themselves from their own conditions

---

### FC5 — Fixing the Use of “Reality”

**Statement**
“Reality” names whatever can count as something at all under admissible predication. No further contrast remains beyond this fixing.

**Constraint Type**
Constraint on global contrast.

**Role**
This constraint prevents appeals to a residual “reality-in-itself” that supposedly outruns all conditions of determinacy while remaining something one can meaningfully refer to. Any such contrast would itself require application conditions and therefore fall under the same constraints.

**What It Constrains**

* Noumenal remainders
* Reality contrasted with intelligibility itself
* Appeals to an ontological “beyond” with no application conditions

---

## Status of the Constraints

Taken together, FC1–FC5 do not describe the world or advance an ontology. They articulate the **constitutive conditions under which anything can count as something at all**.

Once these constraints are fixed, further results follow—not by stipulation, but by tracing what can no longer be coherently distinguished. At this stage, only the minimal structural conditions on determinacy are made explicit.
