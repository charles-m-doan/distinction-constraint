# Determinacy

## Why Define Determinacy Minimally as Exclusion / Contrast?

---

## 1. The Target: A Minimal Notion

“Determinacy” here names the **least** that must be in place for anything to count as *applying rather than not applying*.  

The proposal is deliberately spare:

> **Determinacy = minimal exclusion**  
> the capacity to draw *this rather than not-this*.

This is **not**:
- a psychological state,
- a metaphysical glue,
- an epistemic guarantee.

It is a **condition of content**—what must already be in play for application to be intelligible at all.

---

## 2. Candidate Weaker Notions — and Why They Collapse

### A. Mere Occurrence / Performance

**Proposal:**  
Application is just producing a sound, mark, or performance.

**Collapse:**  
Mere occurrence cannot distinguish:
- assertion from quotation,
- mistake from success,
- rule-following from random emission.

If there is no difference between “applies” and “doesn’t apply,” the notion of application has disappeared. Occurrence can be described without invoking meaning; it cannot ground meaning.

---

### B. Association / Tendency

**Proposal:**  
Determinacy consists in stable associations—“P” tends to be used with certain stimuli.

**Collapse:**  
Tendencies are compatible with systematic error and uninterpretable regularities. A thermostat has tendencies; that alone does not yield predicate application.

Application requires a distinction between **correct** and **incorrect** output relative to a target. Association smuggles in exclusion via *counts as matching* vs. *doesn’t*.

---

### C. Gradience-Only / Degrees Without Boundaries

**Proposal:**  
Determinacy is merely graded similarity, never exclusion.

**Collapse:**  
Even gradience requires contrasts to be *about* anything:
- more or less **of what**?
- similar to **which** standard rather than another?

If absolutely no exclusion is possible, “more” and “less” lose anchoring. Gradience presupposes a dimension that differentiates cases—i.e., a structured contrast space.

---

### D. Deflationary Communal Convergence

**Proposal:**  
Determinacy is whatever a community converges on.

**Collapse:**  
Convergence only matters if there is a difference between:
- converging on the same thing vs. different things,
- uptake that preserves content vs. drift that changes it.

Without exclusion, “converged” is indistinguishable from *happened to behave similarly*. Normativity re-enters.

---

**Diagnosis:**  
In every weak option, determinacy is either:
- absent (and application evaporates), or
- reintroduced implicitly as exclusion somewhere else.

---

## 3. Candidate Stronger Notions — and Why They Overcommit

### A. Determinacy as Bivalence  
*(Every claim is true or false.)*

**Overcommitment:**  
Many meaningful expressions are vague, context-sensitive, probabilistic, or incomplete. Global bivalence turns a condition of intelligibility into a substantive semantic theory.

---

### B. Determinacy as Complete Specification  
*(Fully explicit rules.)*

**Overcommitment:**  
Ordinary concepts function with partial, defeasible, and revisable conditions. Requiring total explicitness excludes most real discourse and introduces an unrealistic ideal. Worse, “fully explicit” becomes a new standard whose application conditions must themselves be settled.

---

### C. Determinacy as Metaphysical Essence

**Overcommitment:**  
Appeals to essences, natures, or perfectly carved joints add ontology rather than analyze intelligibility. Determinacy becomes dependent on a background metaphysics instead of serving as a diagnostic constraint on metaphysical claims.

---

### D. Determinacy as Epistemic Certainty

**Overcommitment:**  
One can apply a predicate determinately while being mistaken, uncertain, or corrigible. Determinacy concerns what would count as correct vs. incorrect—not whether one is sure.

---

**Diagnosis:**  
Strong notions confuse determinacy with particular semantic, metaphysical, or epistemic packages.

---

## 4. Why Exclusion / Contrast Is Minimal, Sufficient, and Unavoidable

### Minimal

Exclusion is the least structure needed for content.  
If “P applies to x” is to mean anything, it must rule out at least one alternative—namely, “P does not apply to x.”

This requires:
- no sharp boundaries,
- no complete rules,
- no essences,
- no certainty.

Only that a contrast is *in principle* in play.

---

### Sufficient

Once exclusion is available:
- agreement and disagreement become possible,
- correction and mistake are intelligible,
- learning and revision have a target.

Anything richer—probability, vagueness, context dependence—is an elaboration of a contrast space, not an alternative to it.

---

### Unavoidable in Practice

Attempts to deny exclusion must still differentiate:
- assertion from non-assertion,
- endorsement from refusal,
- meaning from noise.

That differentiation **is** exclusion.

## 5. UpShot

Determinacy should be defined minimally as exclusion/contrast because:

- weaker notions cannot sustain application, and
- stronger notions introduce unnecessary commitments.

Exclusion is what remains when everything optional is stripped away.
