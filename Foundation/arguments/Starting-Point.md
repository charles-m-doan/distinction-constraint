# Why Determinate Application Is Unavoidable

## 1. Starting Point

Anything that counts as *encountered*, *noticed*, *observed*, *thought*, *said*, *denied*, or *taken to be the case* already purports to **apply** in some way—to sort what is in play into at least two sides:

> this rather than not-this  
> relevant rather than irrelevant  
> present rather than absent  

If nothing could *in principle* make a difference to whether something is encountered, observed, or taken as applying in one way rather than another, then nothing has been encountered or observed *as anything at all*. Activity may continue, but **application has dropped out**.

Determinacy is therefore not an optional feature of language, thought, or theory.  
It is what it is for there to be **any intelligible world-involvement whatsoever**.

## 2. Rejection Strategies

Several familiar strategies attempt to resist this conclusion. Each can be adopted as a posture; the issue is whether it can be **stated or enacted without relying on what it denies**.

1. **Radical indeterminacy**  
   Nothing is ever determinately encountered, applied, or differentiated.

2. **Deflationary “use-only” strategy**  
   Application is nothing over and above communal usage, with no correctness conditions.

3. **Private fixing strategy**  
   Application is fixed by stipulation, intention, or inner grasp.

4. **Purely negative strategy**  
   Only denials, suspensions, or ineffability claims are allowed; positive application is avoided.

5. **Meta-level escape**  
   Determinacy is required only *within* ordinary engagement; a deeper level of reality or encounter is free of it.

## 3. Diagnosis of the Rejections

### 3.1 Radical Indeterminacy

If the claim *“nothing is determinately encountered or applied”* is asserted, that assertion itself must determinately exclude its negation—namely, that something *is* determinately encountered or applied. Otherwise it is not a claim but a noise.

Even reformulating the view as *“it is indeterminate whether application is determinate”* does not help. The expression still purports to apply to this situation rather than not, to rule something in rather than out.

What the position attempts to withdraw—**exclusion**—reappears in the act of stating it.

If the retreat continues (“even that isn’t determinate”), intelligibility is not preserved but abandoned. The posture becomes indistinguishable from total non-engagement, except that words or experiences still occur without content.

---

### 3.2 Deflationary “Use-Only” Strategy

Saying *“application is just use”* does not remove determinacy; it relocates it.

For any practice, there must still be a difference—however socially constituted—between:
- uptake that preserves content vs. uptake that distorts it,
- continuation of the same practice vs. drift into a different one,
- successful coordination vs. breakdown.

If no such differences obtain, “use” cannot do any explanatory work. Practice itself presupposes contrasts internal to practice, and those contrasts are determinacy-laden.

Absent them, the view collapses into: things happen with sounds, gestures, or responses. That is not an account of application or meaning, but an abdication.

---

### 3.3 Private Fixing Strategy

If application is fixed by inner grasp, intention, or stipulation, there must still be a difference between:
- grasping the intended content vs. failing to,
- applying it consistently vs. not,
- remembering it vs. confabulating,
- encountering *this* rather than *that*.

Without such contrasts, “private fixing” fixes nothing. The appeal to the inner does not evade determinacy; it presupposes it to distinguish success from failure.

If the response is that there is no fact of the matter even about inner success, then nothing remains that could count as meaning, application, or encounter rather than the mere occurrence of mental events.

---

### 3.4 Purely Negative Strategy

A denial (“X is not the case”) still depends on application. It must:
- exclude the affirmation of X, and
- apply to some target rather than none.

Likewise, suspension must be distinguishable from assent, denial, confusion, or refusal to engage.

“Ineffability” claims behave the same way. To say *“it cannot be encountered or said”* is to classify it as unsayable or unencounterable rather than otherwise. If that classification is not determinate, the claim has no content.

Negativity does not escape determinacy. It reinstates it at the level of what the negative posture is doing.

---

### 3.5 Meta-Level Escape

The meta-level escape grants determinacy to ordinary engagement but denies it at a “deeper,” “prior,” or “more fundamental” level of reality or encounter.

But describing a level as *deeper*, *prior*, or *outside* is already contrastive. It distinguishes levels, orders them, and applies predicates to them. That requires the very determinacy being exempted.

If the reply is that those terms do not determinately apply at the deep level, then nothing has been stated about that level. The escape succeeds only by forfeiting intelligibility altogether.

---

## 4. UpShot

Every attempted rejection of determinate application does one of two things:

- it covertly **relies on determinacy** to state itself and distinguish itself from its negation, or
- it **abandons intelligibility entirely**, collapsing into a posture without content.

Determinate application is unavoidable because it is not a thesis *within* engagement with the world.  
It is **what it is for there to be any intelligible engagement with the world at all**.
